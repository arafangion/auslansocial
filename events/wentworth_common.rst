Come join us at the BBQ's in Wentworth Common on Saturday 15th May from 11 AM to 12:30 PM for a social chat!

It is freezing, so bring very very warm clothes!  Maybe even use the BBQ's to give yourself a nice warm drink...

This area is dog-friendly (But not off-leash, they always need a leash!), and kid-friendly (there is a nearby playground).

We meet every 2 weeks, but do join us on `Telegram <https://t.me/joinchat/Vp4H8QfKcbU1ZjQ1>`_ and make contact in case the event has been cancelled due to weather, covid, etc.
